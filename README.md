# C String Reversal Application

## Introduction
Welcome to my String Reversal Application project! This C program is designed to reverse the words in a given sentence while preserving the order of the words. The program handles punctuations, alphabetic characters, and spaces, creating a reversed version of the input sentence.

## Features
- Accepts a sentence as input, including punctuations and spaces.
- Reverses the words in the sentence while maintaining the order of the words.
- Handles various punctuation marks and alphanumeric characters.
- Outputs the reversed sentence.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   - git clone https://github.com/Anfaal25/String-Word-Reversal.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd c-String-Word-Reversal

3. Compile the `main.c` file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):
   - gcc -o string_reversal main.c


4. Run the compiled executable:
   - ./string_reversal

5. Enter a sentence when prompted and see the reversed sentence as output.

## Example
- Input:

Enter a sentence: Hello, World! This is a sample sentence.

- Output:

Reversed sentence:
olleH ,dlroW! sihT si a elpmas .ecnetnes

## Conclusion
This String Reversal Application demonstrates my proficiency in C programming and my ability to manipulate strings, handle characters, and implement logic for reversing words in a sentence. Feel free to explore the code and try different input sentences to see how the program performs!
